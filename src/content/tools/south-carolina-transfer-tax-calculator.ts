    <h2>South Carolina Deed Recording Fee Guide</h2>
    <p>South Carolina charges a <strong>deed recording fee</strong> (also called deed stamps or transfer tax) on real property transfers. This state-level fee is one of the key closing costs sellers should budget for when selling property in South Carolina.</p>
    
    <h3>South Carolina Transfer Tax Rates</h3>
    <p><strong>Rate:</strong> $1.85 per $500 (or fraction thereof) of property value</p>
    <p><strong>Alternative expression:</strong> $3.70 per $1,000</p>
    <p><strong>Breakdown:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>State portion: $1.30 per $500</li>
      <li>County portion: $0.55 per $500</li>
    </ul>
    <p>South Carolina's deed recording fee is calculated by dividing the sale price by $500, rounding up to the nearest whole number, then multiplying by $1.85.</p>

    <h3>Who Pays South Carolina Deed Stamps?</h3>
    <p>Traditionally, the <strong>seller pays deed recording fees</strong> in South Carolina. However, this is negotiable between parties in the purchase agreement. The fee is collected at closing by the attorney or closing agent.</p>

    <h3>How South Carolina Deed Stamps Work</h3>
    <p>The deed recording fee in South Carolina applies to all standard real estate transactions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Single-family home sales</li>
      <li>Condominium sales</li>
      <li>Vacant land transfers</li>
      <li>Commercial property sales</li>
      <li>Multi-family property sales</li>
      <li>FSBO (For Sale By Owner) transactions</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>South Carolina Transfer Tax Examples</h3>
    <p><strong>Example 1: $250,000 Single-Family Home</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sale Price: $250,000</li>
      <li>Calculation: 500 increments × $1.85 = $925</li>
      <li>Total Deed Recording Fee: $925</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Example 2: $300,000 Condominium</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sale Price: $300,000</li>
      <li>Calculation: 600 increments × $1.85 = $1,110</li>
      <li>Total Deed Recording Fee: $1,110</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Example 3: $425,000 Property</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sale Price: $425,000</li>
      <li>Calculation: 850 increments × $1.85 = $1,573</li>
      <li>Total Deed Recording Fee: $1,573</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>No Additional Local Transfer Taxes</h3>
    <p>Good news for South Carolina property owners: <strong>cities, counties, and municipalities cannot add their own transfer taxes</strong> unless they had one in place before January 1, 1991 (grandfathered). This means the state rate of $1.85 per $500 is the maximum you'll pay across the entire state.</p>

    <h3>Recording Fees vs. Transfer Tax</h3>
    <p>It's important to distinguish between:</p>
    <p><strong>Deed Recording Fee (Transfer Tax):</strong> $1.85 per $500 - the main state transfer tax</p>
    <p><strong>Actual Recording Fees:</strong> $10-$50 per document - the fee charged by the county clerk's office to file and record documents</p>
    <p>Both are due at closing, but the transfer tax ($1.85 per $500) is the much larger expense.</p>

    <h3>Exemptions from South Carolina Deed Recording Fees</h3>
    <p>Certain transactions are exempt from deed recording fees:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Transfers to/from spouse (or former spouse per divorce decree)</li>
      <li>Foreclosure deeds or deed in lieu of foreclosure</li>
      <li>Quitclaim/corrective deeds with no consideration</li>
      <li>Certain family/business entity transfers (see SC Code Title 12, Chapter 24)</li>
      <li>Government entity transfers</li>
      <li>Gifts with no consideration</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To claim an exemption, you must provide documentation per South Carolina Department of Revenue guidelines.</p>

    <h3>How South Carolina Compares to Other States</h3>
    <p>At $1.85 per $500 (0.37%), South Carolina's deed recording fee is moderate compared to other states:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Lower than:</strong> Pennsylvania (2%), Delaware (4%), New York (1-2%)</li>
      <li><strong>Higher than:</strong> Texas (0%), Louisiana (0%), Utah (0%)</li>
      <li><strong>Similar to:</strong> Georgia (0.1% state + local), North Carolina (varies by county)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tax Deductibility of SC Deed Recording Fees</h3>
    <p><strong>Not deductible</strong> on federal income tax returns as a direct expense.</p>
    <p><strong>Can reduce capital gains:</strong> Deed recording fees count as selling expenses, lowering your taxable profit when you sell.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Sell for $300,000, bought for $250,000, $1,110 in deed stamps → Taxable gain is $48,890 instead of $50,000</p>

    <p><strong>Shop title insurance:</strong> South Carolina allows competition for title services</p>

    </ul>

      <li>Wholesaling contracts may owe deed stamps on assignment</li>
      <li>LLC transfers may trigger deed recording fee</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Coastal vs. Inland South Carolina</h3>
    <p>While the deed recording fee is uniform statewide, other closing costs vary:</p>
    <p><strong>Coastal Areas (Charleston, Myrtle Beach, Hilton Head):</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Higher property values = higher absolute deed fee</li>
      <li>Flood zone requirements common</li>
      <li>Wind/hurricane insurance riders</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Inland Areas (Columbia, Greenville, Spartanburg):</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lower property values = lower absolute deed fee</li>
      <li>Fewer flood zone requirements</li>
      <li>Standard homeowner's insurance</li>
    </ul>
