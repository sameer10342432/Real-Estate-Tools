# What If I Pay Extra Mortgage Calculator

## Overview

Discover the powerful impact of making extra mortgage payments. Even small additional payments can save tens of thousands in interest and shave years off your mortgage term.

## How Extra Payments Work

When you make an extra payment on your mortgage, 100% goes toward your principal balance. This reduces the amount of interest you'll pay over the life of the loan and shortens your payoff timeline.

### Types of Extra Payments

**Monthly Extra Payments**
- Most effective strategy
- Consistent reduction in principal
- Easiest to budget and maintain

**Yearly Lump Sum**
- Annual bonus or tax refund
- One large payment per year
- Significant impact with each payment

**One-Time Extra Payment**
- Windfall or inheritance
- Immediate principal reduction
- Permanent interest savings

**Bi-Weekly Payments**
- Pay half your mortgage every 2 weeks
- Makes 13 payments per year (26 half payments)
- Automatic extra payment built in

## The Impact of Extra Payments

### Example: $300,000 Mortgage at 6.5%

**Standard 30-Year Payment**
- Monthly Payment: $1,896
- Total Interest: $382,633
- Payoff Time: 30 years

**With $200/Month Extra**
- Monthly Payment: $2,096
- Total Interest: $269,180
- Interest Savings: $113,453
- Payoff Time: 23 years 4 months
- Time Saved: 6 years 8 months

**With $500/Month Extra**
- Monthly Payment: $2,396
- Total Interest: $194,311
- Interest Savings: $188,322
- Payoff Time: 17 years 10 months
- Time Saved: 12 years 2 months

## Strategies for Making Extra Payments

### The "13th Payment" Method
Make one extra full payment per year:
- Divide monthly payment by 12
- Add that amount to each monthly payment
- Result: One extra payment annually

**Example:**
- Monthly payment: $1,896
- Divided by 12: $158
- New monthly payment: $2,054
- Savings: ~$66,000 interest, ~5 years

### Round-Up Strategy
Round your payment to the next hundred or thousand:
- Payment: $1,896
- Round up to: $2,000
- Extra per month: $104
- Simple and psychological win

### Match Your Raise
When you get a salary increase:
- Apply the raise amount to mortgage
- No impact on current budget
- Accelerates payoff painlessly

### Windfall Payments
Apply unexpected money to principal:
- Tax refunds
- Work bonuses
- Inheritance
- Side income

## When Extra Payments Make Sense

**Good Idea When:**
- High interest rate (6%+)
- Early in loan term (first 10 years)
- No higher-interest debt
- Emergency fund is established
- No better investment opportunities

**Reconsider When:**
- Low interest rate (3% or less)
- Other debt has higher rates
- No emergency fund
- Better investment returns available
- Tax deduction is valuable

**Prioritize Instead:**
1. High-interest credit cards (15-25%)
2. Personal loans (8-15%)
3. Auto loans (5-8%)
4. Emergency fund (3-6 months expenses)
5. Then extra mortgage payments

## Tax Implications

**Mortgage Interest Deduction**
- Deductible up to $750,000 loan amount
- Must itemize deductions
- Extra payments reduce future deductions

**Standard Deduction**
- $14,600 (single) / $29,200 (married) for 2024
- Most homeowners take standard deduction
- Extra payments don't affect this

**Investment Alternative**
- Mortgage interest: 6.5%
- After-tax cost (24% bracket): ~4.9%
- S&P 500 average return: ~10%
- Consider opportunity cost

## Extra Payment Rules & Tips

### Prepayment Penalties
- Check your mortgage terms
- Most modern loans have no penalty
- FHA, VA, USDA loans: no prepayment penalty
- Some adjustable-rate mortgages may have penalties

### How to Specify Extra Payments
Always indicate "apply to principal":
- Online payment: check "principal only" box
- Check payment: write "principal only" in memo
- Call lender to confirm application

### Avoid Common Mistakes
- Don't skip required payment
- Don't count escrow as principal
- Specify principal on payment
- Get confirmation from lender

- Extra payment: $100/month
- Results:
  - Interest saved: $56,842
  - Time saved: 5 years 8 months
  - ROI: 100% principal reduction

### Example 2: Yearly Bonus

- Standard payment: $2,661
- Yearly extra: $5,000
- Results:
  - Interest saved: $162,418

### Example 3: Bi-Weekly Payments
- Loan: $350,000 at 6.75%, 30 years
- Monthly payment: $2,270
- Bi-weekly payment: $1,135 (every 2 weeks)

## Advanced Strategies

### Recasting vs. Extra Payments
**Mortgage Recast:**
- Make large lump sum
- Lender reamortizes loan
- Lower monthly payment
- Keeps same term and rate
- Fee: $200-500

**Extra Payments:**
- Any amount, any time
- Reduces payoff time
- Payment stays same
- No fees

### Split Between Savings and Extra Payments
Balanced approach:
- 50% to emergency fund/investments
- 50% to extra mortgage payments
- Builds wealth while reducing debt

### Accelerated Payoff Plan
Target payoff date and work backward:
- Goal: Pay off in 15 years
- Current: 30-year mortgage
- Calculate required extra payment
- Adjust as needed

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is it better to make monthly or yearly extra payments?

Monthly extra payments are more effective because they reduce the principal balance sooner, preventing interest from accruing on that amount. However, yearly payments are also valuable if monthly isn't feasible.

### Can I make extra payments on FHA/VA/USDA loans?

Yes, all government-backed loans allow extra payments without penalty. In fact, it's encouraged to reduce overall borrowing costs.

### Should I pay extra or invest the money?

Compare your mortgage rate to expected investment returns. If your mortgage rate is 6.5% and you can earn 8%+ investing, investing may be better. Also consider your risk tolerance and debt comfort level.

### Will extra payments lower my monthly payment?

No, extra payments reduce your balance and shorten your loan term, but your required monthly payment stays the same. If you want a lower payment, consider a mortgage recast or refinance.

### Can I still deduct interest if I pay extra?

Yes, you can still deduct mortgage interest on your taxes if you itemize, even when making extra payments. The deduction is based on interest actually paid.
