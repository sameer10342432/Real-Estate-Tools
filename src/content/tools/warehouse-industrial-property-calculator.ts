    content: `
    A warehouse/industrial property calculator helps investors evaluate distribution centers, logistics facilities, manufacturing buildings, and flex/warehouse spaces.

    ### Understanding Industrial Real Estate

    Industrial properties are experiencing strong demand driven by:

    - Distribution/warehouse: 5-10 years
    - Manufacturing: 10-15 years
    - Build-to-suit: 15-20 years
    - Renewal options: 5-year increments

    **Rent Escalations:**
    - Fixed: 2.5-3.5% annually

    - Basic property coverage
    - Often passed to tenant (NNN)

    **Property Taxes**
    Varies by location
    - Passed through in NNN leases
    - Consider annual increases (3-5%)

    **Capital Reserves**
    5-8% of gross income
    - Roof replacement (15-25 year cycle)
    - Parking lot resurfacing
    - Dock equipment
    - HVAC systems

    ### Revenue Considerations

    **Base Rent**

    - Tax and insurance pass-throughs
    - Utility reimbursements

    **Additional Income:**
    - Yard storage fees
    - Antenna leases
    - Excess power charges
    - Trailer parking fees

    ### Value-Add Strategies

    **Increase Rents:**
    - Upgrade to LED lighting
    - Install or upgrade dock equipment
    - Resurface and expand parking/truck courts
    - Add or upgrade office space
    - Improve security systems
    - Increase power capacity

    **Reduce Expenses:**
    - Solar panels (industrial roofs ideal)
    - Energy-efficient HVAC
    - Roof coatings (reduce HVAC costs)
    - Renegotiate service contracts

    **Repositioning:**
    - Convert to higher-use (manufacturing to logistics)
    - Subdivide large space for multi-tenant
    - Add mezzanine office space
    - Improve truck court and circulation

    ### Investment Metrics

    **Cap Rates:**
    - Class A logistics: 4-6%
    - Class B warehouse: 6-8%
    - Older/secondary markets: 7-10%

    **Cash-on-Cash Returns:**
    - Target: 8-12%
    - Value-add: 12-18%

    **Appreciation:**
    - Driven by rent growth
    - NOI growth compresses cap rates
    - Limited new supply in infill areas

    ### E-Commerce Impact

    **Surging Demand:**
    - E-commerce requires 3x more warehouse space than traditional retail
    - Last-mile facilities in high demand
    - Automation increasing space needs

    - Expansion rights
    - Height restrictions
    - Parking requirements
    - Loading dock requirements

    **Market Analysis:**
    - Submarket vacancy rates
    - New construction pipeline
    - Tenant demand by type
    - Competing properties
    - Market rental rates

    ### Financing Industrial Properties

    **Conventional Loans:**
    - 25-30% down payment
    - Interest rates: 6-8%
    - Terms: 5-10 years
    - Amortization: 20-25 years
    - Requires 1.25x DSCR

    **SBA 504 Loans:**
    - 10% down for owner-occupied

    - Rates based on tenant credit

    ### Common Investment Mistakes

    **Functional Obsolescence:**
    Old buildings with low ceilings, poor layouts, inadequate power

    Poor highway access, truck restrictions, residential encroachment

    **Over-Improvement:**
    Spending more on upgrades than market supports

    **Ignoring Environmental:**
    Contamination liability can be catastrophic

    **Under-Reserved CapEx:**
    Roofs, pavement, and systems are expensive to replace

    ### How This Calculator Works
