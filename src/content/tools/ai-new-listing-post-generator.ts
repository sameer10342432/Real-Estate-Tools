    <h2>What is a "New Listing" Post?</h2>
    <p>A "New Listing" social media post is a property announcement that real estate agents share when a new home hits the market. These posts serve as the digital first impression of a property, designed to generate buyer interest, schedule showings, and create urgency. In today's market, 90% of home buyers begin their search online, making social media the critical first touchpoint.</p>

    <h3>Why "New Listing" Posts Are Critical to Sales Success</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Immediate Exposure:</strong> Reach thousands of potential buyers instantly, before MLS syndication completes</li>

      <li><strong>Algorithm Favorability:</strong> New listing posts generate high engagement, boosting organic reach</li>
      <li><strong>Buyer Database Activation:</strong> Your followers are pre-qualified—many are actively searching or know someone who is</li>
      <li><strong>Seller Satisfaction:</strong> Demonstrates marketing activity and justifies your commission</li>

      <li><strong>Thursday-Saturday Optimal:</strong> Buyers browse listings on weekends, plan for Saturday/Sunday showings</li>
