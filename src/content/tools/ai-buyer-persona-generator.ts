        <li><strong>Too Many Personas:</strong> Start with 2-3 primary personas maximum</li>
        <li><strong>Static Personas:</strong> Update annually as markets and generations evolve</li>
        <li><strong>Not Actionable:</strong> Include enough detail to guide actual marketing decisions</li>

        <li>Gather feedback—do persona insights match what clients tell you?</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Evolving Personas Over Time</h3>
      <p>Buyer behavior changes, so update personas regularly:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Review annually or when market conditions shift significantly</li>
        <li>Incorporate new technology adoption patterns</li>
        <li>Adjust for generational shifts (millennials aging, Gen Z entering market)</li>
        <li>Update based on economic changes affecting your market</li>
        <li>Refine based on campaign performance data</li>
        <li>Add new personas as you expand into new niches</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Implementing Persona-Based Marketing</h3>
      <p><strong>Step 1: Audit Current Marketing</strong></p>
      <p>Review existing content, ads, and outreach—which persona does each piece target?</p>
